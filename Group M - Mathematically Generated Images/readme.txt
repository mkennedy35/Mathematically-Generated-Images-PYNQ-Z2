Group M
Mathematically Generated Images
===================

This project was designed and tested using a PYNQ-Z2 board, which is recommended.
To install, connect the PYNQ board to a computer, and place the entire folder called "Group M - Mathematically Generated Images" on to the top level of storage of the PYNQ board's micro SD card. 

This directory includes the Jupyter Notebooks for each section, which are used to run the main functionality of this project. Also included are the hardware description files required for the overlays, and a subdirectory "images" which stores all the images used for illustration purposes in the notebook.

When running the code in the Jupyter Notebooks, ensure that you read the text before each cell before running it, and make sure that the code cells are run in the order they are presented.
