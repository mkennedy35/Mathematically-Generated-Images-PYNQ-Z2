    "Fractal Trees are images with a self-repeating structure. In this case the structure is repeated as each branch is a repetition of the initial trunk of the tree. At the end of each branch, two more branches begin, where these branches are smaller versions of the branch they came from. This is done using recursion, which is where a solution to a problem relies on solving smaller instances of the same problem. In this scenario, it is done by calling the function to draw a tree from within itself in order to draw the two new branches. An example of a fractal tree is shown in the image below. "

    "In order to off-load some processing on to the PL of the PYNQ board, an IP core was made to approximate the sine and cosine of a given angle using CORDIC. Sine and Cosine are used in the drawTree function in order to calculate the endpoint of each branch. CORDIC stands for COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer [1]. It can be used to calculate hyperbolic and trigonometric functions and is well suited to FPGAs as the only operations it requires are addition, subtraction, bitshift and table lookup, and as such works well with fixed point numbers. The IP was developed using the CORDIC 6.0 System Generator block [2]."
